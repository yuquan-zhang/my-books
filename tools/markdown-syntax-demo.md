A Second Level Header

Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country. This is just a
regular paragraph.

The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy
dog's back.

###### Markdown uses asterisks and underscores to indicate spans of emphasis.

Some of these words *are emphasized*.
Some of these words _are emphasized also_.

Use two asterisks for **strong emphasis**.
Or, if you prefer, __use two underscores instead__.

##### LISTS

Unordered (bulleted) lists use asterisks, pluses, 
and hyphens (*, +, and -) as list markers. These three markers are interchangable;

this:

*   Candy.
*   Gum.
*   Booze.

this:

+   Candy.
+   Gum.
+   Booze.

and this:

-   Candy.
-   Gum.
-   Booze.

Ordered (numbered) lists use regular numbers, followed by periods, as list markers:

1.  Red
2.  Green
3.  Blue

If you put blank lines between items, youâ€™ll get <p> tags for the list item text. You can create multi-paragraph list items by indenting the paragraphs by 4 spaces or 1 tab:

*   A list item.

    With multiple paragraphs.

*   Another item in the list.

##### LINKS
Markdown supports two styles for creating links: inline and reference. With both styles, you use square brackets to delimit the text you want to turn into a link.

Inline-style links use parentheses immediately after the link text. For example:

This is an [example link](http://example.com/).

Optionally, you may include a title attribute in the parentheses:

This is an [example link](http://example.com/ "With a Title").

Reference-style links allow you to refer to your links by names, which you define elsewhere in your document:

I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][1] than from
[Yahoo][2] or [MSN][3].

[1]: http://google.com/        "Google"
[2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  "Yahoo Search"
[3]: http://search.msn.com/    "MSN Search"

The title attribute is optional. Link names may contain letters, numbers and spaces, but are not case sensitive:

I start my morning with a cup of coffee and
[The New York Times][NY Times].

[ny times]: http://www.nytimes.com/

##### IMAGES
Image syntax is very much like link syntax.

Inline (titles are optional):

![alt text](./logo.ico "Title")
Reference-style:

![alt text][id]

[id]: ./logo.ico "Title"

##### CODE
In a regular paragraph, you can create code span by wrapping text in backtick quotes. Any ampersands (&) and angle brackets (< or >) will automatically be translated into HTML entities. This makes it easy to use Markdown to write about HTML example code:

I strongly recommend against using any `<blink>` tags.

I wish SmartyPants used named entities like `&mdash;`
instead of decimal-encoded entites like `&#8212;`.

To specify an entire block of pre-formatted code, indent every line of the block by 4 spaces or 1 tab. Just like with code spans, &, <, and > characters will be escaped automatically.

If you want your page to validate under XHTML 1.0 Strict,
you've got to put paragraph tags in your blockquotes:

    <blockquote>
        <p>For example.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <javascript>
        var a = 1;
        var b = 2;
        var c = a + b;
        console.log(c);
        var str = "this is just a very long long long long long long long long code string";
    </javascript>

this is the **END**;
